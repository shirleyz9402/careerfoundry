# Given more time...

1. I would implement react router to change the address based on slug corresponding to the course selected
2. Play around more with the styling both css and bootstrap to make it more aesthetically appealing
3. Include links on the navbar
4. Include more description about the courses and make it possible to bookmark course the user is interested in
